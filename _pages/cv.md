Education
======
National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)                 
School of Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics Engineering (2020 – Current)
Fields: 
* Topography II 
* Regional Urban Planning & Sustainable Development

Work experience
======
* National Observatory of Athens (11/07/2024 – 10/09/2024 Athens, Greece)

--> Internship at the Department Beyond Centre of EO Research & Satellite Remote Sensing

During an internship at the Beyond Earth Observation Center of the National Observatory of Athens (June–September 2024), I focused on wildfire mapping, risk assessment, and satellite data analysis using Sentinel-2 imagery, QGIS, and Python. I began with manual burned area mapping and statistical extraction, followed by the analysis of fire reports and active fire data from MODIS, VIIRS, and EFFIS. I contributed to the evaluation of the FireHub service using SEVIRI data and photointerpretation. As part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS), I supported EMSN196 (Zambia) through land use change detection and data validation. I later worked on EMSN200 (Falakro) and EMSN197 (Azores), contributing to fire delineation, map production, geodatabase creation, and the development of Web Maps, Scenes, and Dashboards. In the final stages, I developed Python tools for automating the retrieval of cloud-free imagery and burned area mapping, and created a machine learning dataset to support fire risk forecasting.
