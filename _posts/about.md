I am an undergraduate student at the School of Rural and Surveying Engineering â€“ Geoinformatics Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, currently completing my thesis which focuses on wildfire danger forecasting using machine learning techniques and specifically Positive Unlabeled techniques. My academic background combines geoinformatics, data science and remote sensing, with a strong interest in deep learning, spatial analysis, and the development of data-driven solutions. I am particularly drawn to applying emerging technologies to address environmental challenges and support informed decision-making. -->
